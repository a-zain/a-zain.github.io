The BJP has close ideological association with ultra-right-wing Hindu organization the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh which laid foundation of modern-era Hindutva movement, and incidents of persecution and intolerance towards minorities have also increased under rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since 2014. Especially the Muslims of India have been tagged as the foreigners by the BJP. This study uses the three-dimensional model of critical discourse analysis presented by Norman Fairclough to qualitatively assess the textual and visual discursive texts shared by the Bharatiya Janata Party and its key leaders on Twitter during 2019 election campaign. Additionally, the election speeches of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have also been analyzed through development of themes and sub-themes on the basis of the essentials of populism and Hindutva doctrine simultaneously. The mythological and historical basis of Hindutva doctrine, and theoretical debate on populism have also been taken into consideration to find answers to the research questions and it was found that the Hindutva ideology played a central role in the electoral campaign of the BJP and helped it in the construction of the people and the antagonizing others, the identification of a charismatic leader, the portrayal of politically reluctant agenda and the definition of a foreign enemy. It was also found that the BJP excessively used historical and mythological references, symbolism, ritualistic notions and promised Hindutva- focused political and constitutional reforms to assert that it was the contemporary political face of the Hindutva doctrine and that it was totally committed to the cause of Hindutva. This study hence demonstrates how the political and public discourse of the world’s largest democracy is being shaped by using ultra right-wing populist discourse as an effective tool of political communication to pave the way for reduced political liberties, undemocratic practices and Hindu chauvinism.","tags":[],"title":"Master's Thesis: The Hindutva Doctrine and Bharatiya Janata Party in 2019 Elections in India: Critical Discourse Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Zain","Gokcce Ozsu","Binark Mutlu","Gidreta Abdulaziz Dino"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593664637,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593664637,"objectID":"627872f6cdbb9b89d4dd8f6eee97ea9d","permalink":"https://a-zain.github.io/publication/asian20/","publishdate":"2020-07-27T21:37:17-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/asian20/","section":"publication","summary":"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is most crucial trade route in contemporary South Asia which connects Pakistan’s Gwadar port located in Balochistan province and China’s Kashgar, shortening the Middle Eastern oil route for China. It happens to be a core project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which embodies Chinese alternative globalization and encompasses commercial and cultural routes and infrastructure in the participating countries. Although the BRI mainly involves the state institutions of the participating nations, the historic nature of cultural, political and economic relationships of these countries with China affect the political engagement and shape the public discussion about the BRI and its regional projects including the CPEC. Just like each participating country, Pakistan also attaches discrete significance to BRI and puts extraordinary emphasis to secure its respective regional and economic interests, while China has also boosted its public and cultural diplomacy to make ground for its successful execution. This study has undertaken a thematic analysis of the contents produced by ‘opinion technicians’ on Twitter from Pakistan during and immediately after China’s Second Belt Road Forum (2019) as Pierre Bourdieu asserts that officials, opinion leaders, and leading institutions qualify to become the opinion technicians and shape dominant public opinion by the application of framing and priming in the light of local politics and agendas. The study found that the technicians of opinion are effectively adopting the multi-thematic discourse, and portray the CPEC as landmark project which has already started economic and industrial transformation in Pakistan and also holds potential benefits such as poverty alleviation, foreign investments and extended access to Chinese markets to exemplify the win-win cooperation in near future.","tags":[],"title":"CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR AND TECHNICIANS OF OPINION IN PAKISTANI TWITTERSPHERE: A THEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Zain"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592680740,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592680740,"objectID":"96d3d2780b595e5cfbdbd5e9aa5a83ef","permalink":"https://a-zain.github.io/publication/contact-and-sanction/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T12:19:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/contact-and-sanction/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Contact and Sanction: Use of Cricket as Diplomatic Tool by India and Pakistan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Zain"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583123885,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583123885,"objectID":"2ed2069bd019426b01db7cfb299bf553","permalink":"https://a-zain.github.io/publication/book-aging/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T21:38:05-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/book-aging/","section":"publication","summary":"Yaşlanma devam ettikçe, 2020’de 65 yaş üstü insanların dünya nüfusunun %17'sini oluşturarak, bilinen insan tarihinde ilk defa 5 yaşın altındaki çocuk nüfusundan daha fazla yüksek bir sayıya ulaşmaları bekleniyor (He ve diğ, 2016). Dünya Sağlık Örgütü'nün (WHO) “Yaşlanma ve Sağlık” (2018) raporunda yer alan bir tahmine göre, dünya nüfusunun %22’si, 2050 yılında 60 yaşın üzerinde olacak.

Bu aynı zamanda yaşlılar arasında “teknoloji kabulünü” artırmak için bir hareketi de içeriyor; Ancak, çalışmalar bu açıdan oldukça karamsar bir tablo ortaya koyuyor.

It was found that ageingfriendly smartphones have metallic body structure, large display, icons and text fonts, simplified navigation, text-to-speech and speech-to-text feature, and technical and emergency support facilities. Although all of these features successfully address the inabilities of seniors and explain the nature of usability of smartphones among them, there is a need to move towards more universal and inclusive designing of user-interface of smartphones for their universal adoption.

It is often associated with democracy; however, the theorists mainly depend on a specific political context to describe populism (Mouzelis, 1985; Taguieff, 1995). This context carries such features as the distasteful involvement of a highly emotional but simple political rhetoric and opportunistic policies aimed to seek votes only (Mudde, 2004), and most importantly a dominant leader (Taggart, 2000). The political scenario of the 21st century is full of all these characteristics and the populist wave is today more versatile and stronger than ever. Among other political leaders, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a distinctive figure who actively engaged the new media technologies to mediatize his version of populism in a developing country like India. With this, Modi has successfully engraved a tech-savvy image of himself to publicize his motto of “Modi-fied India”. Social media networks, particularly Twitter, have not only helped him reach out to his followers but also served as a medium to connect him to mainstream media. These platforms have been valuable for him to reshape his public image and align himself with the aspirations of a modern India as its leader (Pal, 2015). This article is an attempt to explain how Narendra Modi’s political campaign carried the features of populism and how new media technologies and social media networks facilitated him to popularize his political rhetoric.","tags":[],"title":"RISE OF MODI'S TECH-POPULISM IN INDIA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Zain","Muhammad A.
